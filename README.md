# Machine-Laerning-Nanodegree-boston_housing_Project_by_MD_Alamgir
Evaluation of  the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. The model used is Decision Tree and uses Python. The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. Scikit-learn GridSearch hyperparameter tuning is used along with k-fold cross validation has been used in the model.tuning and validation.
